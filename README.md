Enhancing User Experience with "Calculate and Pay" FeatureÂ Suggestion


Enhancing GPay: Introducing the "Calculate and Pay" Feature
Hello, I'm Atharva Bankar, a dedicated GPay user. I genuinely appreciate the ease and innovation that GPay brings to digital transactions, making it my go-to platform. I'd like to share an idea that could elevate the user experience and attract even more users.

The Challenge:
Often, users find themselves toggling between the calculator app and GPay when managing payments, particularly in situations like purchasing multiple items or splitting bills. Adjustments in total amounts require recalculations in a separate app before finalizing the payment in GPay. This can feel inconvenient and time-consuming.

The Solution:
Imagine a "Calculate and Pay" feature embedded directly within the GPay app. By integrating a calculator into the payment interface, users could effortlessly compute totals without leaving GPay. This would be a game-changer, especially for group payments at restaurants, where quick, accurate calculations are essential.

The Impact:
In a competitive UPI landscape, continuous innovation is key to retaining and growing the user base. A significant portion of UPI users are students and young adults who often need to calculate sums before making payments. By adding this feature, GPay could become the top choice for users seeking both convenience and efficiency. This enhancement would not only improve the user experience but also attract users from other platforms.

Thank you for considering this suggestion. I'm excited about the potential of this idea and would love to discuss how it could be brought to life in GPay.

Best regards,
Atharva Bankar
